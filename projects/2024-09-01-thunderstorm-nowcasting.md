---

## Overview  
During my role as a Software Developer Intern (June–September 2024), we developed an **AI-powered nowcasting model** to predict thunderstorm formation using radar data. The project involved building a full machine learning pipeline, optimizing model performance, and deploying a lightweight web-based interface.

### **🔧 Data Engineering**
- Processed **20GB+ of raw radar data** into high-resolution image tensors.  
- Built a data transformation pipeline supporting augmentation, normalization, and sliding-window sampling.  
- Automated preprocessing scripts using Python, NumPy, and OpenCV.

### **🤖 Model Development**
- Designed and trained deep learning models using **TensorFlow and PyTorch**.  
- Achieved **92% prediction accuracy** by tuning architectures and hyperparameters.  
- Reduced model **inference runtime by 50%** through optimization and pruning.

### **🌐 Full-Stack Deployment**
- Created a **Flask backend** to serve predictions via REST API.  
- Built a clean frontend using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for radar-image upload and inference display.  
- Deployed the system on a lightweight local server for live demonstration.
