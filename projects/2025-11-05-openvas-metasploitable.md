# Lab: Kali (OpenVAS/CIS Benchmark) → Metasploitable - Multi-vulnerability Remediation

**Author:** Tung Nguyen  
**Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Environment:** Kali attacker VM + Metasploitable target VM (host-only network)

---

## Summary
This lab demonstrates the discovery and remediation of high-impact vulnerabilities on a Metasploitable 2 VM using Greenbone/OpenVAS (GVM) as the primary scanning tool. Given that Metasploitable 2 contains hundreds of intentionally vulnerable services, this project focuses on realistic and critical issues, guided by the CIS Ubuntu Linux Benchmark to prioritize remediation.

Each vulnerability is documented with:
- Pre-remediation evidence (OpenVAS scan, nmap, service testing, screenshots)
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation steps aligned with CIS guidance
- Post-remediation verification

This approach ensures reproducibility, demonstrates secure configuration practices, and aligns lab remediation with industry standards.

---

## Environment & VM configuration
- Hypervisor: VirtualBox / VMware  
- Kali VM: 6 GB RAM, 2 CPU, host-only network  
- Metasploitable VM: 1 GB RAM, 1 CPU, host-only network  
- Tools used: Greenbone/OpenVAS (GVM), nmap, ss/netstat, bash, basic Linux utilities  

---

## Workflow Summary
1. Boot Kali and Metasploitable VMs on an isolated host-only network.  
2. Identify the target IP with host discovery (`nmap`).  
3. Start Greenbone/OpenVAS (`gvm-start`) and run a full system scan.  
4. Review OpenVAS results and map each finding to relevant **CIS Ubuntu Linux Benchmark** controls.  
5. Prioritize vulnerabilities using CIS guidance (disable insecure services, remove backdoors, enforce authentication, update legacy software).  
6. Investigate each finding on the Metasploitable VM (`inetd.conf`, service configs, version checks, credential testing).  
7. Apply remediation according to CIS recommendations (disable service, remove package, enforce password, etc.).  
8. Re-scan with OpenVAS and validate remediation (port closed, login blocked, service removed).  
9. Document all evidence and before/after comparisons.

## Vulnerability Template
Use this template to add additional vulnerabilities:

### Vulnerability: <SHORT TITLE> — <SERVICE / PORT>
**Severity:** <High / Medium / Low>  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** <OpenVAS NVT or CVE>  

**Description (short):**  
A one-sentence summary of the issue.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- GVM finding screenshot: `/images/<filename>`  
- `nmap` or port scan output:
# Example
nmap -sT -p 1-65535 <target-ip> -->

---

### Vulnerability: Ingreslock Backdoor (Port 1524) {#vulnerability-ingreslock-backdoor-port-1524}
**Severity:** High  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *TCP Port 1524: Ingreslock Backdoor*

**Description (short):**  
The `inetd` configuration contained an entry that spawned `/bin/bash` as root when the service was contacted. This effectively functions as a backdoor, allowing anyone who can connect to that port to obtain a root shell.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- OpenVAS finding screenshot:  
  ![OpenVAS finding](../images/IngresLock-OpenVAS.png)
- `nmap` scan showing port 1524 open (before remediation):
  ![Port 1524 open before remediation](../images/ingreslock-scan-test.png)
- Snippet of `/etc/inetd.conf` showing the malicious entry:
  ![inetd.conf with malicious entry](../images/Inetd.conf-file.png)

**Root cause analysis:**  
A line in `/etc/inetd.conf` mapped the `ingreslock` service to `/bin/bash` and ran it as `root`. Since `inetd` launches the configured program with root privileges, any network connection to that service resulted in a root shell being spawned.

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Removed the malicious `ingreslock` line (`ingreslock stream tcp nowait root /bin/bash bash -i`) from `/etc/inetd.conf`.
2. Reboot to apply the change.
3. Scan again using nmap to make sure the port is closed and unable to netcat to it anymore.

### Vulnerability: Rexec / r‑services (Port 512) {#vulnerability-rexec-r-services-port-512}

**Severity:** High  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *TCP Port 512: rexec (r‑services)*

**Description (short):**  
The target exposes the legacy `rexec` (r‑services) daemon on TCP port 512. R‑services transmit credentials in plaintext and are considered insecure; an exposed `rexec` allows remote command execution and is a significant misconfiguration.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- OpenVAS finding screenshot:  
  ![OpenVAS finding - rexec](/images/rexec-openvas.png)
- `nmap` scan showing port 512 open (before remediation):  
  ![nmap port 512 before remediation](/images/rexec-nmap-scan.png)
- `inetd` configuration showing the `rexec` entry (example):  
  ![inetd.conf with rexec entry](/images/rexec-inetd.conf-file.png)  
  _Observed line (lab):_  
exec stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rexecd

**Root cause analysis:**  
The `rexec` service was enabled via the system's `inetd` configuration. Because rexec performs plaintext authentication and is rarely required, having it enabled on a networked host exposes credentials and allows remote execution.

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Removed/disabled the `rexec` entry (`exec stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rexecd`) from the inetd configuration.
2. Reboot to apply the change.
3. Scan again using nmap to make sure the port is closed.

### Vulnerability: MySQL / MariaDB Default Credentials (Port 3306) {#vulnerability-mysql-mariadb-default-credentials-port-3306}

**Severity:** High  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *MySQL / MariaDB Default Credentials (MySQL Protocol)*

**Description (short):**  
The MySQL server allowed authentication as `root` with an empty password, permitting administrative access to the database service.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- OpenVAS finding screenshot:  
  ![OpenVAS MySQL finding](../images/mysql-openvas.png)
- Lab test: successful login as `root` with no password (before remediation):  
  ![Successful login without password](../images/mysql-test-login.png)

**Root cause analysis:**  
The MySQL instance was left with a blank/weak root password and accepted remote connections. This allowed unauthenticated administrative access. On many intentionally vulnerable images (like Metasploitable) default credentials are present for testing, but on real systems this represents a critical misconfiguration.

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Logged into the MySQL server locally (lab) and set a strong root password. 
2. Test login again without password -> Failed
![Change password and test login without it](../images/mysql-change-password.png)
3. Test login again with password -> Success
![Successful login with the correct password](../images/mysql-test-login.png)

### Vulnerability: vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoored Version (Ports 21 & 6200) {#vulnerability-vsftpd-2-3-4-backdoored-version-ports-21-6200}

**Severity:** High  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *vsftpd Compromised Source Packages Backdoor Vulnerability* (CVE-2011-2523)

**Description (short):**  
The system was running the backdoored version of **vsftpd 2.3.4**, which contains a hidden backdoor that spawns a remote shell on port **6200/tcp** when triggered by a malformed FTP login (username containing `:)`). This allows full remote compromise of the host.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- OpenVAS finding showing vsftpd 2.3.4 running on port **21** and **6200**:
  ![vsftpd found port21](../images/vsftpd-port-21-detect.png)
  ![vsftpd found port6200](../images/vsftpd-port-6200-detect.png)
- Nmap showing vsftpd version 2.3.4 running:  
  ![vsftpd 2.3.4 running](../images/vsftpd-nmap-confirm-version.png)
- Metasploit successfully exploited the backdoor and obtained a shell:  
  ![vsftpd version evidence](../images/vsftpd-metasploit-confirm.png)

**Root cause analysis:**  
A compromised upstream source package of vsftpd 2.3.4 was installed. This tainted version was distributed for several days in July 2011, and any system using it exposes a built-in backdoor. When triggered, the service opens a command shell on port 6200, giving attackers full remote code execution.

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Since Metasploitable 2 uses outdated repositories and cannot be updated normally, the secure remediation is to remove the vulnerable vsftpd 2.3.4 entirely.
![vsftpd removing](../images/vsftpd-removed.png)
2. Verified that:
- Port **21** no longer runs vsftpd 2.3.4  and Port **6200** is closed:
![vsftpd confirm removed](../images/vsftpd-nmap-confirm-removed.png)
- Metasploit now fail:
![vsftpd remediation success](../images/vsftpd-metasploit-fail.png)

### Vulnerability: rlogin Passwordless Login (Port 513){#vulnerability-rlogin-passwordless-login-port-513}
**Severity:** High  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *rlogin Service Allows Passwordless Login*

**Description (short):**  
The `rlogin` service on port 513 allowed remote login without requiring a password, giving attackers direct shell access over the network. This is caused by legacy `r‑services` being enabled in `/etc/inetd.conf`.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**
- OpenVAS finding screenshot:  
  ![OpenVAS finding](../images/rlogin-openvas.png)
- `nmap` scan showing port 513 open:
  ![Port 513 open before remediation](../images/rlogin-nmap-scan-yes.png)
- Snippet of `/etc/inetd.conf` showing the malicious entry:
  ![inetd.conf with malicious entry](../images/rlogin-inetd-conf.png)
- Successful attempt to use rlogin passwordless:
  ![rlogin Passwordless success](../images/rlogin-access-success.png)

**Root cause analysis:**  
The Metasploitable machine had the legacy rlogind service enabled through inetd.
The following entry existed in /etc/inetd.conf:
`login stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.rlogind`
rlogin trusts remote hosts and uses plaintext communication, often allowing logins with no password, resulting in full user compromise (and privilege escalation in many cases).

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Removed the malicious line from `/etc/inetd.conf`.
2. Reboot to apply the change.
3. Scan again using nmap to make sure the port is closed and unable to attemp passwordless rlogin:
  ![rlogin Passwordless remediation success](../images/rlogin-test-after-rem.png)

### Vulnerability: Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities (Port 8787){#vulnerability-druby-rce-port-8787}
**Severity:** High (CVSS 10.0)  
**OpenVAS ID / Reference:** NVT – *Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities*

**Description (short):**  
Distributed Ruby (DRb) allows Ruby objects to communicate over a network.  
By default, DRb does **not** restrict which clients may connect or what methods they can invoke.  
When the service is exposed on a network interface without ACLs, `$SAFE` restrictions, or input validation, attackers can execute arbitrary Ruby expressions, including `syscall`, resulting in **remote code execution (RCE)**.

**Evidence (pre-remediation):**  
- OpenVAS finding and response from sending an invalid syscal:  
  ![OpenVAS finding](../images/druby-openvas.png)
- `nmap` scan showing DRb service exposed on port 8787:
  ![Port 8787 open before remediation](../images/druby-nmap-showing-open.png)
- Snippet of vulnerable DRb Ruby script `druby_timeserver.rb` running with no ACLs and low $SAFE level
  ![DRb timeserver script](../images/druby-timeserver-rb-file.png)

**Root cause analysis:**  
The DRb service was running with insufficient security controls:
- `$SAFE` level was only **1**, which does **not** restrict system calls or dangerous Ruby operations.
- No DRb ACLs (`drb/acl`) were configured, allowing any remote host to connect.
- No input sanitization or taint checking was applied.
- The DRb service was exposed on `0.0.0.0:8787`, making it reachable from external networks.

This configuration allowed the scanner to execute a malicious DRb request and receive a **syscall error trace**, proving arbitrary code execution was possible.

**Remediation performed:**  
1. Restricted DRb access using ACLs (`drb/acl`) to allow only trusted hosts.  
2. Increased Ruby `$SAFE` level to **2** to block unsafe remote operations.  
3. Rebound the DRb service to `127.0.0.1` to eliminate external exposure.
_All changes are shown in the combined configuration below:_  
![DRb hardening changes](../images/druby-remediation.png)
4. Restarted the DRb service to apply the updated ACL and safety settings.
5. Re-scanned using nmap and openVAS to confirm:
