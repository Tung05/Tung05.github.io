## Overview

Participating in a hands-on IoT Cyber Defense externship focused on securing real-world IoT infrastructure for a simulated 500-room smart hotel environment. The program covers threat modeling, secure pipeline design, device identity management, encryption, replay attack prevention, monitoring, and AI-based anomaly detection.

This externship simulates the responsibilities of a security engineer defending production IoT systems.

## Project 1: IoT Systems & Threat Modeling ✅

### Deliverable
📄 [View Threat Model (PDF)](../images/Tung%20Nguyen%20-%20Threat%20Model%20.pdf)

### Work Completed
- Applied the CIA Triad to IoT environments  
- Analyzed six major IoT attack types  
- Used STRIDE methodology to identify system vulnerabilities  
- Delivered a professional threat model for a smart water management system  

### Key Skills
- Threat modeling  
- STRIDE framework  
- Risk analysis  
- Security architecture evaluation  

### Key Takeaway
Understanding system architecture before implementing defenses is critical.  
Threat modeling exposed vulnerabilities in authentication, message integrity, and device trust boundaries that were not obvious at first glance.

- Used Pandas for data cleaning and validation  
- Built scripts to analyze sensor anomalies  

### Key Skills
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Data validation

## Upcoming Projects (Coming Soon)

### Project 3: Building an Insecure MQTT Pipeline
Construct and exploit an insecure MQTT data pipeline to understand real-world interception risks.

### Project 4: Securing the Pipeline with TLS
Implement TLS encryption and evaluate security-performance tradeoffs.

### Project 5: Device Identity & Provisioning
Implement certificate-based authentication and prevent rogue devices.

### Project 6: Replay Attack Simulation & Defense
Simulate replay attacks and implement timestamp and counter-based defenses.

### Project 7: Real-Time Security Dashboard
Build a live security monitoring dashboard using Streamlit.

### Project 8 (Optional): AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Apply Isolation Forest to detect spoofed readings, timing inconsistencies, and anomalous IoT behavior.
